Hey!

I'm Peter.

![Me at the Summit 2024 @ San Francisco](https://cloud-44lucepe1-hack-club-bot.vercel.app/0summit.jpg)

I'm a 16-year-old club leader from Singapore, and I run a Hack Club (one of the four in Singapore!) at Stamford American International School.

When I first walked into high school as a wide-eyed Grade 9 student, I had no idea I'd soon be juggling more lines of code than hours of sleep (_author's note:_ please get 9 hours of sleep - you won't regret it). The SAIS Hack Club, which started as a wild idea between homework sessions and jazz band practice and now with over 40 members, quickly transformed into my passion project, my haven, and sometimes, my chaos.

Against all odds, we thrived. We managed to secure over $2000 in funding, which, if you ask me, felt like an endless supply of pizza (_author's note:_ because let’s be honest, Hack Club runs on boba and pizza). Every week, we hacked away with our projects for one hour, innovating and sometimes breaking things, but always learning and growing (_author's note:_ mostly breaking things).

Conducting weekly workshops was my way of giving back. Each week, I taught front-end development and other computer science skills to club members and watched as curiosity turned into capability. I learned that teaching is the best way to learn, and my members constantly surprised me with their creativity and resilience.

By the end of it, it wasn't just about the code; it was about proving that innovation isn't reserved for the "adults."

My role didn't just stop at the school gates. Being part of the global Hack Club community meant I got to extend my influence and connect with brilliant minds from across the globe. The Summit in San Francisco this February was a turning point. Being invited to serve as a panel leader on diversity and inclusion was an honor. It was a room full of energy, ideas, and, most importantly, hope. Hope that young leaders can change the world, one line of code at a time (_author's note:_ and maybe a few memes along the way).

Reflecting on my journey, it’s funny how what started as a small initiative in my school turned into something much bigger. It taught me leadership, perseverance, and the importance of diversity in tech. It showed me that with enough passion and a bit of craziness, you can turn a wild idea into a thriving community.

So here I am, still a bit wide-eyed but now with a lot more experience and a ton of stories. Leading the SAIS Hack Club has been a rollercoaster, but I wouldn’t trade it for anything. To anyone thinking of starting something new, especially if it seems a bit wild – do it. The chaos is worth it, and the creativity it unleashes is unparalleled. (_author's note:_ also, don't forget the snacks. and the music.)
