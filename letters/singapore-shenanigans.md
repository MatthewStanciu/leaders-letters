  Hey! I'm Peter, and I'm a 16-year-old Hack Club leader from Singapore. Here's an interesting story of how I lost my hours of sleep to some teenage shenanigans and started building more Hack Clubs in Singapore.

Hey!

I'm Peter.

(see me standing next to Tom Preston-Werner there? I felt very cool for a second.)

I'm a 16-year-old club leader from Singapore, and I run a Hack Club (one of the four in Singapore!) at Stamford American International School.

When I first walked into high school as a wide-eyed Grade 9 student, I had no idea I'd soon be juggling more lines of code than hours of sleep (_author's note:_ please get 9 hours of sleep - you won't regret it). The SAIS Hack Club, which started as a wild idea between homework sessions and jazz band practice and now with over 40 members, quickly transformed into my passion project, my haven, and sometimes, my chaos.

Against all odds, we thrived. We managed to secure over $2000 in funding, which, if you ask me, felt like an endless supply of pizza (_author's note:_ because let’s be honest, Hack Club runs on boba and pizza). Every week, we hacked away with our projects for one hour, innovating and sometimes breaking things, but always learning and growing (_author's note:_ mostly breaking things). From coding challenges to building mini-games, and even prototyping solutions for real-world problems, our workshops became a sandbox for creativity.

Conducting weekly workshops was my way of giving back. Each week, I taught front-end development, web programming, and other computer science skills to club members and watched as curiosity turned into capability. We dabbled in JavaScript, explored the ins and outs of HTML/CSS, and even took a detour into Python for those keen on data science. I learned that teaching is the best way to learn, and my members constantly surprised me with their creativity and resilience.

But it wasn't just about technical skills. We also delved into discussions on the ethics of AI, the future of blockchain, and how technology can drive social change. By the end of it, it wasn't just about the code; it was about proving that innovation isn't reserved for the "adults."

My role didn't just stop at the school gates. Being part of the global Hack Club community meant I got to extend my influence and connect with brilliant minds from across the globe. The Summit in San Francisco this February was a turning point. Being invited to serve as a panel leader on diversity and inclusion was an honor. It was a room full of energy, ideas, and, most importantly, hope. Hope that young leaders can change the world, one line of code at a time (_author's note:_ and maybe a few memes along the way).

The Hack Club Leaders’ Summit wasn’t just a conference; it was a melting pot of ideas. I shared the stage with incredible minds, discussing challenges like how to make tech more accessible to underrepresented communities. We brainstormed initiatives, shared success stories, and even planned cross-continental collaborations.

Reflecting on my journey, it’s funny how what started as a small initiative in my school turned into something much bigger. Organizing BuildingBloCS 2024 was another milestone. It was the first time I got to see the impact of my work on a larger scale, as students from across Singapore came together to participate in our AI-themed hackathons. Featuring Dr. He Ruimin, Singapore’s Chief AI Officer, in a fireside chat was surreal, but what truly made it special was seeing students from different schools, different backgrounds, all united by their passion for technology.

The success of BuildingBloCS 2024 wasn’t just a win for me; it was a win for the entire Hack Club community in Singapore. It showed that we could create platforms that inspire and empower young innovators. And yes, seeing two new Hack Clubs sprout up as a result of our efforts was the cherry on top.

So here I am, still a bit wide-eyed but now with a lot more experience and a ton of stories. Leading the SAIS Hack Club has been a rollercoaster, but I wouldn’t trade it for anything. To anyone thinking of starting something new, especially if it seems a bit wild – do it. The chaos is worth it, and the creativity it unleashes is unparalleled. (_author's note:_ also, don't forget the snacks. and the music.)
